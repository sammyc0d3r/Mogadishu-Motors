   How the App Works
   Car Information
   The app receives car information from an external API server. This server provides data about various cars, including their specifications, images, and testimonials from users.

API Server
The API server is currently hosted over HTTP. Due to this, modern browsers may block the content as insecure. To ensure the app functions correctly, you need to allow insecure content in your browser.

Allowing Insecure Content
To allow insecure content, follow these steps:

Open your browser settings.
Navigate to the security or privacy settings.
Find the option to allow insecure content.
Enable the option for the site http://mogadishu-motors.vercel.app.
Here is a screenshot to guide you through the process:
